# DecentraVault

DecentraVault is a simple decentralized application (DApp) that demonstrates how
files can be stored on IPFS while their content identifiers (CIDs) are stored on
an Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates real-world decentralized file storage systems used in
blockchain applications. The actual file is stored off-chain on IPFS, while the
blockchain stores a reference (CID) to the file.
